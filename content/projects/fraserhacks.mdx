FraserHacks was a hackathon organized at John Fraser for the entire Peel
district school board. We were able to host over 100 hackers for a 10 hour
event, and managed to organize the entire thing within 2 months.

We were able to allow students to learn and build their passion projects in an
intense, but fun, competition, while providing guidance and support along the
way.

I helped build and maintain the [website for FraserHacks][github], as well as helping with
various administrative and organizational tasks.
