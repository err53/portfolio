Fraser Votes was an online voting system created for John Fraser, utilizing
asymetric encryption for data security. The frontend was built in Gatsby, and we
used Firebase for authentication, as a database, and for hosting.

The encryption was built using PGP: We allowed administrators to generate a
private key, and post a public key to the database. Users would then encrypt
their ID and votes with the private key, which allows administrators to validate
and prevent double voting, while keeping votes private.

While this approach clearly has flaws (namely the potential for administrators
to tamper with the results), we felt that in an environment where these
administrators can still override election results, this flaw was negligible,
and the benefits of easier auditing and understanding of function made it worth
the added insecurity.
